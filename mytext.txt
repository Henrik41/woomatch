Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying Rails 3.1+ on Heroku, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

  5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g devise:views

--------
Assets ... be careful and move all images in stylesheet if you want to use css

---------

A nice clean way to do it is using MiddleWare. Add this class to your lib directory:

# lib/spoof_ip.rb

class SpoofIp
  def initialize(app, ip)
    @app = app
    @ip = ip
  end

  def call(env)
    env['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] = nil
    env['REMOTE_ADDR'] = env['action_dispatch.remote_ip'] = @ip
    @status, @headers, @response = @app.call(env)
    [@status, @headers, @response]
  end
end
Then find an IP address you want to use for your development environment and add this to your development.rb file:

config.middleware.use('SpoofIp', '64.71.24.19')

Had crazy problems with time saving to the database and not passing in the parameters
The problem was that having a textfield for time cannot save the time.
I had to pass separate parameters vis jquery and finally got it to work.

_________\
I used mailboxer

seems to work great.
however added this to the mailler config:

You need to add the following line at every environment:

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "yourhost" }

that way it can works in all the environments and could be different for anyone, for example:

development.rb

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "dev.yourhost.com" }
test.rb

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "test.yourhost.com" }
production.rb

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "www.yourhost.com" }
